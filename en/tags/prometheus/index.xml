      <description>Blackbox exporter can monitor the external services over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP on Prometheus. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to monitor HTTP/HTTPS using Blackbox exporter. Blackbox exporter is going to be running on Kubernetes.
Environment Before you begin, you need to have these:
 Kubernetes Prometheus operator  Blackbox exporter configuration Write the Blackbox configuration file as ConfigMap to configure http module for monitoring web services.</description>

      <description>Istio is open source service mesh. It adds an abstraction layer to the network. It also provides capabilities to connect, manage and secure microservices.
Istio provides built-in configuration profiles. But for production environment, we need to :
 improve performance by using tuned settings. enable SDS to secure gateways. integrate with Prometheus operator, Grafana, Jaeger and Kiali.  Now we&amp;rsquo;ll set up Istio on Kubernetes for production environment.
Install a istio using tuned settings  Download Istio release.</description>

      <description>Prometheus alerting through Alertmanager can be configured to send messages to Email, SMS or messangers. My company uses Microsoft Teams as team messanger. Alertmanager supports Email, HipChat, PagerDuty, Slack etc. natively except Microsoft Teams. So it needs to be used Webhook to send a third-party tool that sends messages to Microsoft Teams.
This post assumes that you are using the Prometheus operator for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster. We&amp;rsquo;re going to know how to send Prometheus alerts to Microsoft Teams.</description>
